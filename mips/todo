on method labels, update the pointers, push the methodSize on localAllocated stack

on methodEnds, pop from LA stack



float - ??
(all instrs for float)
** (exponent) (l3_expr) - left because no mips instr present for it




METHODS
return - set ret value in $v0, sp = fp, set fp = -4(fp), jr ra
getarg - read from fp - 2 * numArgsRead to getReg
methodEnds - pop from local allocated
methodStarts - allocate stack frame by incrementing the sp, set numArgsRead = 0
call - push fp to stack, push ra to stack, fp = sp, jal, set ra = old 0(sp); pop ra,fp, args
param - store on stack after adding to sp
