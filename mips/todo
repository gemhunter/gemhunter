float - (all instrs for float)
string operator
register allocation (static)
case

#METHODS
#return - set ret value in $v0, sp = fp, set fp = -4(fp), jr ra
#getarg - read from (2 + numArgsRead)fp
#methodEnds - pop from local allocated
#methodStarts -  allocate stack frame by incrementing the sp, push to local allocated, set numArgsRead = 0
#call -  push $fp to stack, push $ra to stack, fp = sp, jal, store value from $v0 to line[0], set ra = old 0(sp); pop 2+numargs (ra,fp, args) (take number from symbol table)
#param - store on stack after adding to sp

POSSIBLE
-dict - class support
-yield/block
-super
-for


README
not doing cute dynamic (dispatching and typing) stuff and syntactic sugars
fn can access args and globals only (and self class)
no dynamic scoping for funcs
