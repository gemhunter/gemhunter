gemhunter - a cross compiler for Ruby, written in Python
=======================================================

*The compiler is written in Python, hence no executable was created for it.*

To run the compiler, use the following command:
python src/lexer.py test/nameOfTestFile

We do not provide a makefile since running python is too easy.
