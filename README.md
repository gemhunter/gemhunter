gemhunter - a cross compiler for Ruby, written in Python
=======================================================

**Mah Ruby, Mah rulzz**

*The compiler is written in Python, hence no executable was created for it.*

To run the compiler, use the following command:
`bin/irgen.py test/nameOfTestFile`

This generates output.out file in root folder

We do not provide a makefile since running python is too easy.

To clean directory run `make clean`
